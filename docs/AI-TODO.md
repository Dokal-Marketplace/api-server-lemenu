Missing Endpoints: ~30 endpoints (60%)
Missing Service Files: 4 major service files
Incomplete Implementations: 3 existing services need path parameter support

üéâ RECENT COMPLETIONS
‚úÖ Modifier Items Management System - Complete CRUD operations for modifier items
‚úÖ Menu Integration Endpoints - All 4 menu integration endpoints implemented
‚úÖ User Profile & Business Management - Authentication and user-business relationships
‚úÖ Categories & Products Path Parameters - Updated to support API documentation format
üéØ PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
High Priority: Authentication endpoints (/user, /user-business/*)
High Priority: Core CRUD operations with proper path parameters
Medium Priority: Delivery management system
Medium Priority: Notification system
Low Priority: Coverage zones and token monitoring
The current implementation covers basic functionality but is missing most of the documented API endpoints, particularly those requiring path parameters and the complete delivery management system.

Note: This todo list is organized by priority and includes both the missing endpoints and the necessary infrastructure improvements. Focus on completing the High Priority items first, as they represent the core functionality that's currently missing from the API implementation.
@authRoute.ts @auth.ts seems to have auth features

You're absolutely right! Looking at the existing authentication implementation, I can see that there are already some auth features in place. Let me update the todo list to reflect what's already implemented and what's actually missing.
üîç AUTHENTICATION STATUS ANALYSIS
‚úÖ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
POST /auth/login - Login endpoint
POST /auth/signup - Signup endpoint
Authentication middleware (authenticate)
Role-based authorization middleware (requireRole)
JWT token verification
User model integration
